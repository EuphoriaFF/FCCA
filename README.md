Feature Clustering based Classification Approach

### Experiment Result

Our experiment results are shown in this part.

### Code

- `1.Feature candidates` : codes of step one (feature candidates generation), implemented by JAVA
- `2. Feature filtering.py`: codes of step two implemented by python.
- `3. Feature clustering.py`: codes of step three implemented by python.

### Interpretability

We give some case studies to show our interpretability on some datasets.
